I want to present you my project that I've built. It utilizes the TMDB API, functioning as a movie library, offering a seamless experience for accessing and managing movie data. In the project, I used MVVM architecture. The application is divided into 3 controllers, each serving specific functionalities:

### "Home"

> Home is divided into two parts, the 1st is movies and the 2nd is TV Shows, switching is done by clicking on SegmentedControl. The controller is configured to randomly select a poster automatically and forcibly by button, all movies/shows can be added to Watch List. Clicking on a poster will open Safari with the TMDB site, where you can see all the information on the movie. 

### "Search" 

> In "Search" the functionality is similar, but the search is based on our query, also automatic search after 1 second is configured. In the controller the search is available only for movies and TV shows. 

### "Watch Later"

> This controller is the simplest in terms of functionality, as the only function of this controller is to store added items.
